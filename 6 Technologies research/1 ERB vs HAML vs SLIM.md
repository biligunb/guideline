# Brief information on ERB vs HAML vs SLIM (+HAMLIT)

1. ERB - Embedded Ruby
  - Out of box
  - No need to learn new HTML syntax
  - Best performance?

  - Verbose

2. HAML - HTML abstraction markup language
  - Easy to learn
  - Efficient (no closing tags)
  - Clean syntax

  - Bad performance
  - Whitespace sensitivity

3. HAMLIT - High Performance Haml Implementation
  - Hamlit which is faster than Haml but doesn't support a few things you can easily work around (but might find annoying to have to refactor on an existing project)

4. SLIM - Slim Template Language
  - Clean readable FLEXIBLE syntax
  - Faster than HAML
  - Open Source
  - Supports HTTP streaming
  - Well organized documentation
