# Brief information on ERB vs HAML vs SLIM (+HAMLIT)

### 1. ERB - Embedded Ruby
#### Pro:
    - Out of box
    - No need to learn new HTML syntax
    - Best performance?

#### Con:
    - Verbose

### 2. HAML - HTML abstraction markup language
#### Pro:
    - Easy to learn
    - Efficient (no closing tags)
    - Clean syntax

#### Con:
    - Bad performance
    - Whitespace sensitivity

### 3. HAMLIT - High Performance Haml Implementation
   - Hamlit which is faster than Haml but doesn't support a few things you can easily work around (but might find annoying to have to refactor on an existing project)

### 4. SLIM - Slim Template Language
#### Pro:
    - Clean readable FLEXIBLE syntax
    - Faster than HAML
    - Open Source
    - Supports HTTP streaming
    - Well organized documentation
